# Gliders
Gliders is a project that is inspired by ant simulations and boids simulations.

It is a simulation of small individual dots (gliders) that move around in space.  
Their movement directions is defined on two aspects:  
First they have a tendency to move towards other gliders.  
Second the direction is randomly adjusted.  

This results in organic simulations depending on different parameters, that are beatifull to watch.
