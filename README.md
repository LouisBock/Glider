# Gliders
Gliders is a project that is inspired by ant simulations and boids simulations.

It is a simulation of small individual dots (gliders) that move around in space.  
Their movement directions is defined on two aspects:  
First they have a tendency to move towards other gliders.  
Second the direction is randomly adjusted.  

Additionally there are different groups of gliders.

This results in organic simulations depending on different parameters, that are beatifull to watch.
